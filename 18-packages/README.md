# Packages

Packages can be thought of plug-ins for your code. Sometimes called libraries or modules, packages offer a defined set of functionality you can import into your application. You will find it's almost impossible to create an application which doesn't use multiple packages.

By using **npm** (Node Package Manager) you can access an entire world of tools and resources. If you are trying to implement common services like creating a web application, managing secrets, calling external resources, or incorporating artificial intelligence, chances are there's a package available to suit your needs.
