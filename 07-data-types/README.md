# Datatypes

JavaScript is [weakly typed](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), meaning it does not store the datatype while you are writing your code. However, it does support numerous data types and maintains what datatype a variable is storing at runtime. You can even query a variable to determine the datatype.
